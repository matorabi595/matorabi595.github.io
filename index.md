One of my favorite places at UC San Diego is the Biomedical Library. It is close to where I work, which is the Leitchtag building. Biomedical Library is a quite place to study and you also can borrow a book that you need to study. Here is a picture of it:

### My favorite programming qoute comes from Martin Fowler

> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.



### My Favorite Language

My favorite programming language is python! It is very user friendly and easy to learn. Check this out:


We can store "Hello, Github!" as a variable called string and then we can easily print string:


```
string = "Hello, Github!"
print(string)
```

Output

```
Hello, Github!
```
