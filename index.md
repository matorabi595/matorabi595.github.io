## Welcome to My Page

My name is Mahkameh Torabi. I am a Computer Science major at **UC San Diego**. One of my favorite places at UC San Diego is the Biomedical Library. It is close to where I work, which is the Leitchtag building. Biomedical Library is a quite place to study and you also can borrow a book that you need to study.

We can store "Hello, Github!" as a variable called string and then we can easily print string:


```
string = "Hello, Github!"

Output

```
Hello, Github!
```
